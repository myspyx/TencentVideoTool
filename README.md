# Tencent VOD tools
10c does not have an UI to attach subtitles to videos in their intl console so far. 

and 10c do have a poor UI in their China console, but it's still complicated for user to attach massive subtitles for massive videos.

So we consider build a tool base on 10c API to batch attach subtitles to videos.
We use name conversion to match subtitle to videos as poplular video player doing.
